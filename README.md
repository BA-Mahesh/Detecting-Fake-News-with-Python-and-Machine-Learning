# Detecting-Fake-News-with-Python-and-Machine-Learning
Do you trust all the news you hear from social media?
All news are not real, right? 
How will you detect fake news? 

The answer is Python. By practicing this advanced python project of detecting fake news, you will easily make a difference between real and fake news. Before moving ahead in this machine learning project, Let us know what is fake news, tfidfvectorizer, PassiveAggressive Classifier.
Fake News : fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media
TfidfVectorizer : The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. 
PassiveAggressive Classifier : Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms. Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting

About Detecting Fake News with Python
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.


Libraries Used :
numpy
pandas 
itertools
sklearn.model
train_test_split
sklearn.feature_extraction
 TfidfVectorizer
 sklearn.linear_mode
PassiveAggressiveClassifier
 sklearn.metrics
accuracy_score, 
confusion_matrix

Summary :
 We took a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. We ended up obtaining an accuracy of 92.74%
